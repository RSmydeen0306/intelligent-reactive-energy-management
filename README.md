Intelligent Reactive Energy Management using MATLAB Simulink
üìò Abstract
This project aims to address the issue of poor power factor in industrial electrical systems by implementing an intelligent reactive power compensation system. Using MATLAB Simulink, the model calculates the power factor in real-time and optimally switches capacitor banks to improve system efficiency, reduce power losses, and avoid penalties.

üß† Functional Overview
1. **Voltage & Current Monitoring:** Simulates real-time industrial load conditions.
2. **Power Factor Calculation:** Calculates real, reactive, and apparent power.
3. **Logic Control:** If PF < threshold, the system switches ON capacitor banks.
4. **Capacitor Bank Activation:** Enhances the PF to acceptable limits.
5. **Real-Time Feedback Loop:** Monitors changes and adjusts automatically.
