⚡ Intelligent Reactive Energy Management using MATLAB Simulink
📘 Abstract  
This project addresses the issue of poor power factor in industrial electrical systems by developing an intelligent reactive power compensation system. Using MATLAB Simulink, the system simulates load variations, calculates the power factor in real-time, and activates capacitor banks accordingly. This enhances energy efficiency, reduces transmission losses, and avoids utility penalties.

🧠 Functional Overview  
- **Voltage & Current Monitoring**: Simulates varying industrial load behavior.  
- **Power Factor Calculation**: Calculates real (kW), reactive (kVAR), and apparent power (kVA).  
- **Control Logic**: If the power factor falls below a threshold (e.g., 0.9), capacitor banks are activated.  
- **Capacitor Bank Switching**: Increases the power factor to the optimal range.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Continuously monitors the system and adapts capacitor usage.
